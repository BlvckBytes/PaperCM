# PaperCM

This library integrates [ComponentMarkup](https://github.com/BlvckBytes/ComponentMarkup) with
Adventure, to be directly compatible with modern Paper APIs. A simple POJO config-mapper ensures
the validity of markup and allows for minimal boilerplate use-cases, while being able to report
errors back with the precision of the CM-parser, using absolute line-numbers.

This project is still a work in progress, but will become the standard for all of my future
plugins, seeing how indescribably versatile this way of going about configurability has proven.
